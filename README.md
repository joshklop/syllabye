A simple GUI for managing college course syllabi. A project for CS 3443 Application Programming at UTSA.

# TODO

* [ ] Use `Gson` instead of manual file management
* [ ] Write automated tests
* [ ] Predictable exceptions
* [ ] Organize imports / consistent styling in general
* [ ] Sanity checking all inputs
* [ ] File I/O - prepare for the worst (what if files get deleted, moved, edited while application is open?)
* [ ] Allow application to be resized
